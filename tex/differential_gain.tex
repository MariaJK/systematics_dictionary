\subsection{Differential gain}

\paragraph{Description:}
Miscalibrations of relative bolometer gains in a pixel pair will ``leak'' temperature signal into $Q$ and $U$.
This effect is particularly enhanced if we subtract two bolometers within pairs to obtain the polarized part of the timestream. If we just deconvolved timestreams (using rotating HWP), we might not really care about this?
