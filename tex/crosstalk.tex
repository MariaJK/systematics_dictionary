\paragraph{Description:}
The frequency multiplexing readout has crosstalk due to the finite width of the LC resonators.
Crosstalk from one bolometer to another due to coupling in the multiplexed readout will lead to polarization and temperature leakage from a point outside the main beam, creating a localized, polarized near side lobe. Crosstalk is strongest in bolometer channels that share a SQUID in the frequency-domain multiplexed readout, and are closest together in bias frequency.

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Planet observations (beam maps). \pb\ assumed constant level of crosstalk between neighbour bolometers. We may want to have a spatial distribution across the focal plane for more realism.

\paragraph{Uncertainty/Range:}
