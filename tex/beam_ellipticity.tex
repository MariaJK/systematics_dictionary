\subsection{Beam ellipticity}

\paragraph{Description:}
Many CMB experiments are designed to have angular sensitivity that can be described by an azimuthally symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian function
\begin{equation} 
P (\mathbf{x}) \propto \exp (-\mathbf{x} ^2/2\sigma ^2),
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ represents the width of the beam. Optical aberrations will lead to asymmetries in the angular sensitivity which can often be captured by assuming that the Gaussian beam width is different along the two axis of a Cartesian coordinate system centered on the peak response
\begin{equation}
P (x,y) = \exp (-\frac{1}{2}[x^2/\sigma ^2_x + y^2/\sigma ^2_y]).
\end{equation}
This is referred to as an elliptical Gaussian function. 

\paragraph{Plan to model and/or measure:}
Beam ellipticities are extracted from beam maps which are acquired through scanning of a terrestrial source placed in the far-field of the optical system or by observing astrophysical point-sources such as the planets in our solar system.
