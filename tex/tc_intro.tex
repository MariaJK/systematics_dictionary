Detector time-response features can be probed by scanning quickly over bright objects such as planets, but our ability to probe such features might be limited by the maximum scan speed of the telescope mount. TES bolomoters are instrinsicly quite fast ~ 1 ms time-response. Features due to variation in scan speed might be visible in maps with sufficient integration. Additionally, when using a HWP, changes in time constant can change the apparent polarization angle, which must be corrected for.
