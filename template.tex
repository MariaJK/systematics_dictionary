\subsection{Systematic/Property Name}

\subsubsection{Description}
Description of systematic effect, including relevant equations and
parameterization for TWGs. Note that each variable in each equation should be
defined. This should include where we expect to get the value of this variable
from (TWG, literature, etc.)

\subsubsection{Plan to model and/or measure}
Plan to model/measure effect

\subsubsection{Uncertainty/Range}
This section should include the uncertainty of
known parameters and/or the expected range of parameters for consideration

\subsubsection{Parameterization}
This section should include the parameterization of figures of
merit and the output to the SWGs.
